fgdb should accomodate multiple threads for testing.  For this reason it will need concurrency and a static
capability to create directories, etc.

however, fgdb when built as a library for production use must not self initialize and create directories nor should it
manage concurrency.  for this reason, the concurrency stuff should be gated behind a "test" config so that it's
skipped when the library is built for production use.

the env, dir and path stuff needs to be modified as well as assets.

env should be:
env
  poex
    prod
    test1 through test5
        then for each of these we have
        db - database goes here
        out - any output goes here

cache should be
cache
  poex
    json
    ver
      version.txt or manifest.txt - something used to identify what version of the json we have
